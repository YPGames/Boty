Spitfire was fast and agile.
The An-225 Mriya is the pride of Ukrainian aviation.
The best plane is the one that comes back from the mission.
The Hellcat survived more than you think.
The Zero was beautiful, but dangerous.
My favorite sound is the V12 engine in the Mustang.
RAF pilots knew no fear.
Mriya had six engines and a heart of titanium.
